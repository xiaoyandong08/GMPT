# GMPT

A Computational Method to Dissect Colonization Resistance of the Gut Microbiota against Pathogens

1. Download the example data from Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cvf46f512byzh1c/AADh_XNUpQsom8xpMjSooaWXa?dl=0
2. The main script of GMPT for GLV simulation is "GMPT_pipeline.m". Please see the comments for the meanings of parameters in the script.
3. Here we provide the example of N = 30 to perform GMPT and visualize the results in "Plot_cohousing_process.m" for Fig.2bc and "Plot_GMPT_pipeline.m" for Fig.2defgh. The A matrix and growth rate of this ecological network are stored in "A30_20210907.gml" which can be generated by "togml.m" in "Plot_cohousing_process_Fig2bc.m".
4. "GMPT_ALDEx2_for_all.R" and "GMPT_ANCOM_for_all.R" are R scripts to perform DAA analysis of ALDEx2 and ANCOM.
