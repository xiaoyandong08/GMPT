# GMPT: A Computational Method to Dissect Colonization Resistance of the Gut Microbiota against Pathogens

## Generate the simulated data in folder 'generate simulated data'
1. The scripts can generate the simulated data as shown in Fig.2 and Supplementary Fig.1.
2. The main script for GLV dynamics to generate the simulated data is `Generate_sim_data_for_GMPT.m`.
3. Run `GMPT_ALDEx2_for_all.R` and `GMPT_ANCOM_for_all.R` to get DAA results by ALDEx2 and ANCOM, respectively.

## GMPT performance as shown in Fig.2 and Supplementary Fig.1

1. Download the example data from Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cvf46f512byzh1c/AADh_XNUpQsom8xpMjSooaWXa?dl=0
2. The main script of GMPT for GLV simulation is "GMPT_pipeline.m". Please see the comments for the meanings of parameters in the script.
3. Here we provide the example of N = 30 to perform GMPT and visualize the results in "Plot_cohousing_process.m" for Fig.2bc and "Plot_GMPT_pipeline.m" for Fig.2defgh. The A matrix and growth rate of this ecological network are stored in "A30_20210907.gml" which can be generated by "togml.m" in "Plot_cohousing_process_Fig2bc.m".
4. "GMPT_ALDEx2_for_all.R" and "GMPT_ANCOM_for_all.R" are R scripts to perform DAA analysis of ALDEx2 and ANCOM.
